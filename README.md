Knowing which season and/or month to launch a campaign may be key to success. According to Kickstarter data, successful theater campaigns were launched during late Spring/early Summer (May-June), whereas failed campaigned were launched during the Winter (December).

Some statistics comparing successful and failed plays in the United States showed that a $10,000 budget could be of concern for Louise. The average goal among successful campaigns was $5,049, which is about half of Louise's budget. Failed campaigns' goals averaged to be about $10,000. This may be further supported by the fact that the standard deviation among failed campaigns is almost 3x the IQR of the goal.

Major takeaways:
* Theater/play campaigns have shown success in the U.S. Louise should pursue a "play" Kickstarter.
* Campaigns launched in May/June have been more successul than those launched in December. Louise's "Fever" play should be launched sometime late Spring/early Summer.
* Ambition goals may not lead to successful campaign. Louise should consider reducing her Kickestarter goals.
