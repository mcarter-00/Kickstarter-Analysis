Statistics comparing successful and failed plays in the United States showed that a $10,000 budget could be of concern for Louise. The average goal among successful campaigns was $5,049, which is about half of Louise's budget. Failed campaigns averaged to be about $10,000. However, the average pledge was much larger for successful campaigns than failed campaigns.
