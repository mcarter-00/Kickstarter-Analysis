# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
An analysis was performed using Kickstarter data to help inform Louise about crowdfunding campaigns, and what factors may help her have a successful campaign for her play "Fever" with a $10,000 budget. 

Kickstarter data demonstarted that there has been a total of 912 theater campaigns in the United States. Among these theater campaigns, 525 (58%) were successful campaigns and 349 (38%) were failed campaigns. There were also 12 campaigns that were currently active and 26 campaigns that were cancelled.

Theaters in the U.S. were stratisfied into musicals, plays, and spaces. Plays contributed to theater kickstarters the most, followed by spaces then musicals. Among the 671 "play" kickstarters, 412 (61%) were successful and 250 (37%) failed.

Knowing which season and/or month to launch a kickstarter may be key to success. Data shows that successful theater campaigns were launched during late Spring/early Summer (May-June), whereas failed campaignes were launched during the Winter (December).

Some statistics comparing successful and failed "play" kickstarters in the United States demonstrate that a $10,000 budget could be of concern for Louise. The average goal among successful kickstarters was about $5,000, which is about half of Louise's budget. Failed campaigns' goals averaged to be about $10,000.

Major takeaways:
* Both theater and play kickstarters have shown success in the U.S. Louise should pursue a "play" Kickstarter.
* Kickstarters launched in May/June have been more successul than those launched in December. Louise's "Fever" play should be launched sometime late Spring/early Summer.
* Ambition goals may not lead to successful kickstarter. Louise should consider reducing her Kickestarter goals.
